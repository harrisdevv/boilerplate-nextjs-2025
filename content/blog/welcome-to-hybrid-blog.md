# Welcome to the Hybrid Blog System! 🚀

This blog uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds:

## 🎯 Markdown Files (This Post)

Posts like this one are written in **Markdown files** and stored in `content/blog/`. They offer:

- ✅ **Git-Friendly**: Version control for your content
- ✅ **Developer-Friendly**: Write in markdown or MDX
- ✅ **Fast Performance**: Pre-rendered at build time
- ✅ **SEO Optimized**: Static generation for best search rankings
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Frontmatter validation

### How It Works

When you create a markdown file in `content/blog/your-post.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Your description"
date: "2025-10-21"
tags: ["nextjs", "react"]
---
```

The system automatically:
1. Reads the file at build time
2. Parses the frontmatter
3. Generates SEO metadata
4. Renders it alongside database posts

## 💾 Database Posts

You can also create posts dynamically using the database (via Prisma Studio or an admin interface):

- ✅ **Dynamic Content**: Update without rebuilding
- ✅ **User Management**: Multiple authors
- ✅ **Analytics**: View counters, likes, comments
- ✅ **CMS Integration**: Non-technical editors can create content
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Database queries for complex filtering

## 🔀 Hybrid Routing

The blog system checks for posts in this order:

1. **Markdown files** first (static, faster)
2. **Database** as fallback (dynamic content)

This means:
- Marketing content → Markdown (best SEO)
- User stories → Database (dynamic features)
- Documentation → Markdown (versioned)
- Community posts → Database (user-generated)

## 📝 Creating Markdown Posts

Create a new file in `content/blog/`:

```markdown
---
title: "My Awesome Post"
description: "Learn something amazing"
date: "2025-10-21"
author: "John Doe"
tags: ["tutorial", "nextjs"]
categories: ["Guides"]
