# Product Spec: “One-Prompt, One-Month” Multi-Platform Content Planner (BYOK)

## 1) Overview

Build a lightweight web app that turns **one user prompt** into a **30-day, multi-platform content plan**. The tool analyzes a brand’s positioning (USP, value proposition, competitive advantage), asks about consistency blockers (time, fear, perfectionism), and then generates platform-aware drafts that require short owner inputs—**half human, half AI**.
**MVP excludes scheduling**; users store their social links and manually post with one-click copy/open.

**Pricing model:** one-time $49 lifetime.
**LLM model:** **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** via user’s OpenRouter key to keep owner’s infra costs near zero.

---

## 2) Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**

* Generate **N posts** across user-selected platforms from a single prompt.
* Enforce **authenticity** with mandatory “Owner Inserts.”
* Coach users on **cadence** (how many posts/week) and **length** (words/characters) per platform.
* Provide a clean editor, per-platform variants, and “Open to post” links.

**Non-Goals (MVP)**

* No auto-scheduling or auto-publishing.
* No crawling or scraping social networks.
* No team/approval workflows.

---

## 3) Target Users & Value

* **Solopreneurs, creators, consultants, small brands** who struggle with consistency.
* Value: eliminates blank-page anxiety, provides **structured plan + drafts**, preserves owner voice, and reduces time-to-publish.

---

## 4) Key Concepts

* **Brand Card:** structured summary of positioning, voice, taboos, ICP, differentiators.
* **Consistency Profile:** psychological blockers (time, fear of judgment, perfectionism).
* **Content Plan:** 30-day calendar with themes (Authority, Teach, Proof, Story, Contrarian).
* **Post Spec:** hook options, outline, CTA, asset idea, owner-insert prompts, per-platform variants.

---

## 5) Onboarding Flow (3 minutes)

**Sections**

1. **Business Analysis** (NEW)

   * **SWOT Analysis Generator**: AI-powered or manual input
   * **USP Builder**: Competitive analysis and value proposition
   * **Business Profile Upload**: PDF/document upload for analysis
   * **Industry & Target Audience**: Automated suggestions based on inputs

   * Tone sliders: Formal↔Casual, Warm↔Direct, Tactical↔Visionary
3. **Voice & Proof**

   * 3 past wins/caselets (metric + story)
   * 3 topic pillars (e.g., "Email Growth," "Ops," "Mindset")
4. **Consistency Profile**

   * "Why not posting consistently?" (multi-select): **No time / Fear of judgment / Perfectionism / Don't know what to post / Waiting for perfect offer**
5. **Cadence & Platforms**

   * Desired posts/week and selected platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Threads, X; extensible)
6. **BYOK**

   * User pastes OpenRouter API key (validated server-side; stored encrypted).

---

## 6) Core User Flow

1. **New Plan Wizard**

   * Input: single **topic prompt** (e.g., “B2B onboarding mistakes”), **#posts** (e.g., 30), **platforms**.
   * Output: a **4-week calendar** with diversified themes.
2. **Post Composer**

   * For each Post: 3 **hooks**, **outline**, **base draft** (140–220 words), **CTA**, **asset idea**.
   * **Owner Inserts** (non-skippable): two short fields (e.g., “Add a 2-line metric from last month”).
3. **Platform Fan-Out**

   * Generate variants per platform respecting character budgets and fold points.
   * Show **character meter** and fold preview (“…see more” on supported platforms).
4. **Publish Prep**

   * “Copy” and “Open platform” buttons (user posts manually).
   * Mark as **Posted?** to track streaks and completion.
5. **Consistency Coach**

   * Daily nudges, streak counter, and recommended **word counts** by platform.
   * Behavior adapts to user’s blockers (e.g., “Short on time? Try 70-word version.”)

---

## 7) Feature List (MVP)

* **Business Analysis Suite:** SWOT generator, USP builder, PDF document analysis.
* **Planner:** Topic expansion → 30-day calendar with theme diversity.
* **Editor:** Rich text with placeholders for **[OWNER_LINE_1]** and **[OWNER_LINE_2]**.
* **Per-Platform Variants:** LinkedIn/Instagram/Facebook/Threads/X.
* **Authenticity Meter:** % owner words and presence of specifics/numbers.
* **Character Budgets:** live counters per platform; safe trimming when too long.
* **Assets Suggestions:** image/PDF/carousel idea per post (no generator in MVP).
* **Links Bookmarks:** user's social profile links stored for one-click open.
* **Analytics (light):** posted vs planned, streaks, average words per platform.

---

## 8) Inspiration from Famous Accounts (Ethical Approach)

**Default:** **Off** in MVP to protect authenticity and avoid scraping issues.
**Opt-in, safe mode (post-MVP or beta toggle):**

* Users paste **public URLs** of posts they admire (any platform).
* App extracts **structure only** (hook type, narrative beats, CTA pattern); **no verbatim copying** or storage of third-party text.
* Apply structure to the user’s own ideas/claims/metrics.

> **No automated crawling or scraping** of LinkedIn or any platform in the MVP. If later needed, pursue official partner APIs and permissions.

## 9) Platform Limits (Config Service)

A hot-updatable JSON used by formatter and UI:

```json
{
  "linkedin":   { "charMax": 3000, "foldApprox": 210 },
  "instagram":  { "charMax": 2200, "foldApprox": 125 },
  "facebook":   { "charMax": 5000 },
  "threads":    { "charMax": 500 },
  "x":          { "charMax": 280 }
}
```


## 11) Prompts (LLM Pipeline)

**Planner (cheap/fast model)**

> You are a content strategist. Given {BrandCard, Platforms, PostsCount, DesiredCadence}, produce a 4-week plan with evenly distributed themes (Authority/Teach/Proof/Story/Contrarian). For each post, output JSON with: date, theme, idea, 3 hooks, outline, CTA, asset idea, and two ownerInsertPrompts. Do not generate full text.

**Writer (mid-tier model)**

> Expand a PostSpec into a base draft of 140–220 words. Include two placeholders: `[OWNER_LINE_1]`, `[OWNER_LINE_2]`. Avoid clichés; include one concrete example and one number tied to the ICP. Return plain text.

**Formatter (cheap/fast model)**

> Transform base text for {platform} with charMax {limit}. Put the strongest hook before the fold. Retain `[OWNER_LINE_*]`. Suggest 3–5 relevant hashtags. Return JSON {text, hashtags[], estChars}.

**Optional Polish (user-triggered)**

> Improve clarity and punch ±10% length. Preserve facts, CTAs, placeholders. Return polished text only.

## 12) Security & BYOK Handling

* User pastes OpenRouter key once; server validates with a tiny test call.
* Store keys **encrypted-at-rest** (AES-256-GCM). Never log plaintext. Access only in generation jobs.
* All LLM calls **server-side**; never expose keys client-side.
* Per-user **rate limits** (e.g., 10 req/min) and **daily token caps**.
* Return clear error states: invalid key, quota exceeded, model unavailable.

---

## 13) Cost Control (even with BYOK)

* **Stage routing:** planner (cheap) → writer (mid) → formatter (cheap).
* **Hard caps:** max 30 posts/run, max 3 platforms/run, max 2 rewrites/post.
* **Token diet:** terse prompts, JSON outputs, stop sequences, caching recurring hooks by theme.
* **Human-in-loop:** owner inserts reduce need for full rewrites.

---

## 14) UX Details

* **Calendar view** (month): color by theme; click → editor.
* **Editor layout:** center = base draft with placeholders; right = per-platform variants + character meter; left = posts list.
* **Authenticity meter:** computed from owner insert length, specificity markers (numbers, proper nouns), and repetition checks.
* **Fold preview:** show “…see more” cut approximations where relevant.
* **Quick actions:** “Tighten,” “Expand,” “Short version,” “Long version.”

---

## 15) Error Handling & Edge Cases

* **Over-long prompt or too many posts:** auto split into batches (e.g., 10 at a time).
* **Model timeout:** retry with reduced `max_tokens`; fallback to **skeleton only** (hooks + outline + CTA).
* **Invalid BYOK:** banner with test button and docs link.

---

## 16) Legal & Compliance

* **Terms/Privacy:** explain BYOK storage, encryption, and that content belongs to the user.
* **No scraping/crawling** of social platforms. Inspiration uses **user-provided URLs** and extracts structure only.
* **Anti-plagiarism policy:** originality check, owner inserts, and disclaimers about ToS compliance per platform.

---

## 17) Roadmap (Post-MVP)

* **v0.2:** Light analytics (posted vs planned, streaks, avg words, hook save-rate), export (PDF/CSV).
* **v0.3:** Idea Orchard (auto-suggest 50 prompts from past wins/FAQs).
* **v0.4:** Asset Helper (image/presentation prompt suggestions); simple image generation toggle.
* **v0.5:** Team comments, brand rules lock, shared templates.
* **v1.0:** Scheduler integrations (optional) and apply for official partner APIs where appropriate.
